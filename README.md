### Introduction

 **This is an easy-to-use Launcher for Minecraft. Lightweight, Simple and fast.**

2022.4.6

First of all, this launcher is open source, but not adjusted for the most people. What's more, the author is a student without any income or in a development team. As a result, the launcher is still at the development stage. You can suggest sone good ideas or ask your questions on the GitHub issue. Besides, our group chat always opens to you. No penny required!

This precompiled launcher includes a method, using private api keys such as Microsoft Azure Client ID and CurseForge API Key, so you cannot compile this project after you clone the project. To fix it, you should add an PrivacyMethod.pas in your workspace. For further information, see Privacy.md. You also can fill an empty string value to compile a release without Microsoft OAuth or CurseForge API, without some vital functions.

Btw, this project do **only** support **RAD Studio Delphi** to compile it, it does not support *Lazarus* or *other compiler*.

Additionally, if you want to support the author so that the author can have a good meal, you can donate on Afdian. However, if you are only a child or a worker without a fixed income source, you are absolutely not allowed to give money for me, which may cause a serious impact.

~Oh by the way, this launcher is written in the language Delphi. If you are worried that this launcher contains viruses, you can unpack this launcher or do researches on the code. This launcher does not contain any virus and will not cause any damage to the computer.~ No virus risks with your code reviews!

This launcher is called with the name "Little Limbo Launcher". You also can call it "LaLaLa Launcher". It is up to you. Just enjoy it!
